# Deep Learning Project Implementation

1. **Sequence Labeling:** Speech is composed of phomenes. This project is to predict the associated phone sequences given the acoustic signal.

2. **Video Captioning:** Describe the videos based on content. This project is to generate the description for the given video.

3. **Game Playing:** Game playing is an interaction between a user and an environment. Reinforcement learning can learn the agent's action for plying the games. Including value-based approach and policy-based approach.

4. **Comics Generation:** Conditional image generation is to automatically generate natural images based on the given constraints.
